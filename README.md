Stuff to work around Sql

# Purposee
I discovered and practiced PostgreSQL last year during the 1st covid19 pandemic with [Udacity's nanodegree data enginnering](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027) and [challenges on Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). At the moment I am learning Sql server and I want to improve my practice with other learners. Nothing better than an international community and caring mentors! I would like continue to use Docker too. At home, I work with Solus, a Linux distribution built from scratch,  maintained as "eopkg". At woork, I learn Windows OS. So, I need two Docker with external data and a Makefile...?
